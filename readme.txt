Respected Sir/Mam,
1) I have created a secured registration and login form by using 
nodejs,expressjs,mongoDB,mongoose and RestApi.
2)let's setup my project on your system first. Turn on your mongoDB server on port 27017.
3)Now open the folder in VS code or any IDE of your choice but I recommend VS code as 
I have made this project on it. Now goto terminal and run app.js file , I have already installed
nodemon in this project so you can run nodemon  by simply typing "npm run dev" make sure you
are inside registration_form folder first, or you can use the traditional way and type "node app.js"
once your inside src folder.
4)After you run app.js you would see depriciation warning , I tried my best to resolve it,
but I couldnt't resolve it so for the time being let's ignore it. you will see two messages.
"listening to port" and "connection successful".
5)Now open chrome browser I am running my project on port "8000" so type "http://localhost:8000/"
in the URL and you will goto index page of our project.
6)this is the index/registration page of our project. A new user can enter his details.Or he/she
can sign in if she is already an existing user.
7)If a new user fills up his/her details then he/she will be able to see his/her document 
that has been successfully stored in the "employees" collection of our "user-api" database. 
8)The user will see his/her collection but he/she wont see his/her password as it's secured by
npm's "bcrypt" module.
9)If an already existing user sign in , He/She will be re-directed to login page. After filling
login details and clicking on sign in button. The user will see all the documents present in the
"employees" collection of our "user-api" database except his and other users password.
10)The Instructions in the email that was sent to me was not very descriptive and this is 
what I was able to make after figuring it out. Reach out to me "7020061087" or "arizsiddiqui93@gmail.com"
incase you want me to make changes.
